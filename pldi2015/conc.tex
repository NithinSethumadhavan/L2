We have presented a method for example-guided synthesis of functional programs
over recursive data structures. Our method combines
three key ideas: type-aware inductive generalization, search
over hypotheses about program structure, and  use of deduction to
guide the search. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is  promising.

There are many open directions for future work. We plan
to study ways of exploiting parallelism in our synthesis algorithm. We
are also interested in using our method for synthesizing 
proofs. Several recent papers ~\cite{SGHALN13,GLMN14} have studied
the synthesis of program proofs  from tests (which can be viewed as
examples). We believe that \sys can be used effectively for this
purpose. %and that the richness of the class of programs that \sys
%synthesizes will be particularly beneficial in this space.
